- Do we really need buckets?
- Listening on files, compressing files, version, integrity, etags, 
mirror OS file APIs as much as possible, maybe searching and indexing the files and it's content
- Look into using mdb groups-like system for users and tokens
- Improve the API parameters of the endpoints
- Look into the TODOs in the project
- What fields should be indexed in MongoDB?
- Short links for files
- Skip filenames and generate new ones or appending random strings to filenames
- Pothen name
- Perform existing file check using the file binary / checking that mime is correct using file binary
- Uploading files using parent
- Consider use cases like uploading folders
- Does the user want to override a file or throw an exception if the file exists
- Confirm the places that should be assert split path
- Delete artifacts on resources on delete
- A public page for sharing files and folders
- Error message descriptions
- How do you prevent cyclic preset dependencies among preset permissions?
- Remove unique from schemas and make data unique in handlers
- Make sure that when permission items are being saved, the type matches the resource id,
and other such checks
- Check that update data has data before saving to db
- Validate that endpoints that define their own name char length should use it in their schemas
- Add nice design to email templates
- Add 404 to NotFoundErrors and appropriate status codes for other error types
- Render error messages if the request requests for it, rather thank just json
- Implement payment, rate limiting, etc.
- Implement moving files and folders accross directories
- Logging and what to log
- Improved image fetch transformers
- Transactions
- Write tests for invalid cases and validations
- Write tests that confirm that agents that shouldn't have access to a resource or 
an operation on a resource shouldn't access it
- Do stress test and check speed and perf
- Use upload preflight call to get an id attached to upload calls for quick check and
fail upload early. Don't wait until everything is uploaded. See if multer can do this.
- Have a separate upload and download instance
- Add description field for client assigned token
