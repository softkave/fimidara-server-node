## Server

- resumable uploads
- authentication + authorization + workspaces
- metered read & read capacity
- set cookies
- test that multiple files with same name are not created
- api idempotency
- move from queue waitOnStream to pubsub
- usage thresholds internal and reporting
- docs
- range download
- cookies
- when the agent is public, don't return all data
- add providedId to add and update endpoints for workspace resources
- regex match for email not working because email contained +
- do not require rootname if using token
- there was an error with sharp that broke the instance (maybe not waiting for
  promise is why it breaks app)
- in delete jobs, use versions marked deleted for original objects
- usage records
  - usage records alerting
  - UI to set usage thresholds internal
  - make sure api and users can't set thresholds themselves for now, but can read it
  - UI to update costs, internal
  - limit how many workspaces a user can create, maybe 3 or 5 for now
- go through apis docs
- logs, maybe Sentry
- audit logs
- use local fs?
- check if email recipient is a user and only send login link, or signup link otherwise
- tool to print config without values for env
- email me with new signups in intervals
- what happens when a user still have bandwidth in but no storage?
- fix NotFoundException exception thrown from email deliverability check (AWS SES)
  - switch email to resend
- empty out test s3 bucket and write code to auto clean it after tests
- download folder as zip
- match file with node:fs stat, e.g. last accessed, last status change (though
  we don't have a similar concept), and nano seconds, etc.
- stop workers on sigint
- use uncreated folder and file path for permissions
- when surfacing jobs, make sure to not surface all info because a job can start
  a job owned by a different workspace, like remove collaborator is linked to
  unassigning a permission group owned by fimidara
- check that read available works for all file providers, local, s3, etc.
- add a create empty file endpoint
- delete local dir and file for completed/deleted parts

## JS SDK

- api
  - examples
  - json example code
  - hide N/A
  - sample apps
- auto extract and document exports
- support esm and commonjs (current issue is softkave-js-utils only supports esm, and lodash-es + peer deps)
- readFile typedef should return stream | blob depending on responseType
- diff files content?
- optimize node diff files
- optimize copyFolderFiles because currently we fetch all local and fimidara files for diff
  - issue is diff will be incomplete when we diff on paged results
- authentication + authorization + workspaces
- mount external backends
- image manipulation
- reusable upload hardening
  - set multipart lifecycle in s3
  - cleanup parts on delete file
  - complete multipart upload should be a job and should release file when done. this is primarily for memory and local fs providers
  - write multiparts to local file and stream to backend when merging
  - flush redis on complete testing, and use different database
  - enforce minimum multipart upload size of 5mb bcos of s3
    - if s3 has a 5mb minimum, then we may need to merge some parts internally
- byte range download
- connection pool for redis
- hardening
  - use shard runner for addFolder
    - check if folder exists before sending to shard runner
    - shard runner, who logs errors
  - use shard runner for usage
    - queue in handler by workspaceId + category + operation
  - use shard runner for creating internal multipart ID
    - queue in handler by fileId
    - lock by fileId and get before creating
  - use shard runner for prepare file
    - queue in handler by fileId or filepath
    - lock by fileId or filepath and get before creating
  - concurrency with insertJob idempotency check
  - cache calls to resolveBackendsMountsAndConfigs
  - Mongo unique constraint can serve as an alternative to shard runner
  - multipart file tests should check that binary is correct after upload
- retry failed part uploads
- allow switching between axios and fetch

## CLI

- login
- mute errors not fatal in fimidara sync
  - handle errors per file or global error like auth globally
  - show only error message
- show files it's working on/skipping
- maybe add an option to show files and folders interacted with
- show files and folders in sync it's working on

- it should be clearer when permissions are given to a resource, and when permissions are given to access a resource
- add permissions assigned on accepting collaboration request
- where to report issues
- send email when permissions are assigned and removed
- authentication + authorization + workspaces
- image manipulation
- add that you get $# free hosting for 1 year on fimidara as a banner
