# multi-instance + folder

- lease and push
  - is http
  - can be overwhelmed
  - can hold on to lease for a bit longer then drop
- lease and pull

  - uses db or queue
  - cannot be overwhelmed
  - need notification system when done
  - cannot hold on to lease, or will need poll

- sqs for input
- sns for output

- who creates the queues?
- we still need a lease

DB approach

- put in DB | put in sqs
  - sqs > sns started (nothing caller can do cause it's started, applies to DB too)
  - DB can set status/started/done/error
  - DB can become congested, sqs likely will not
  - DB currently is slower than sqs
- acquire lease -- DB | Redlock on Redis | DynamoDB lock
  - process and update in DB | sqs + sns
  - release lease
- wait on work -- sns
  - how to wait?
    - poll, mongodb streams, sns
  - timeout or return
    - on timeout need to update that work is no longer needed

DB01: work > lease > process|pull > done|error in sns > drop lease
DB02: work > wait > sns out done|error
DB03: work > wait > timeout > end work if not started 
      - update, can be wait a bit if work is started. wait once.

SS01: sqs > lease > process|pull > done|error in sns > drop lease
SS02: sqs > wait > sns out done|error
SS03: sqs > wait > timeout > delete work
      - update, can wait a bit if we get work started sns. wait once.
      - need a job/thread to update sqs message visibility

- static no. of shards, 10 instances
- within an instance, we can use workers

- redis instance
- create queue/list - on startup
- put a message in a queue
- pull messages from a queue
- delete messages from a queue
- put a message in pubsub
- get notified and handle a message from pubsub
- wait on messages or timeout
