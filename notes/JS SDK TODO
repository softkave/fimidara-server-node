- api
  - examples
  - json example code
  - hide N/A
  - sample apps
- auto extract and document exports
- support esm and commonjs (current issue is softkave-js-utils only supports esm, and lodash-es + peer deps)
- readFile typedef should return stream | blob depending on responseType
- diff files content?
- optimize node diff files
- optimize copyFolderFiles because currently we fetch all local and fimidara files for diff
  - issue is diff will be incomplete when we diff on paged results
