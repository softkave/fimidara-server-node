# Fimidara 01

- Storage providers, fimidara, gcloud, aws, azure
- Fimidara offering, workspace, folders, tags, access control
- Manage customer provider keys
- Compute in the cloud provider + region
- Fimidara UI, file tree, display & file editing
- Fimidara as CDN
- DX, SDK, documentation
- Logging
- Edge compute and serving from the edge
- Low latency caching
- Workflows, orchestration, file lifecycle, file processing vendors
- Image and video processing
- File TTL, chunking, seek
- API fitting, like nodejs fs, etc
- Mounting, like as drive on an OS
- Continuous backup like Dropbox
- Events and webhooks
- Encryption at rest
- HTTPS, and customer-own certificates
- Compression

- Permissions
- Storage backends
- Default permission group for collaborators
- Surface type description in or and and combinations
- Use and define sdk params
- Concurrent file writes, and atomics
- Store by how much usage is exceeded so that customers can plan accordingly
- Allow customers specify throttling and rate-limiting
- Keed record of all access and errors, and why, including check auth failures
- Keep record of all permissions used to allow or deny access
- Implement soft-delete through out the app
- Implement streaming + fan out, use case, like listeners, live video, etc
- Separate process file resizing
- File and folder exists + transfer
- Write tests for the new incoming upload file streaming
- Disable usage records for now because we don't have stream content length, and bring it back
- Test that upload file begins processing immediately rather than after all the stream is loaded in memory
- Seek, chunk, move files, and right permission names, should we use file names from multi-part, or allow overwriting
- is-file-owner permission
- Help migrate files from one cloud provider to another
- Soft delete and recreate if resource is created again, particularly for files, and folders
- Encrypt backend provided credentials
- Add how to retrieve backend credentials for each backend
- Test credentials have permission for each provided credential
- Index fields for db schemas
- Flatter endpoint inputs, like add resource endpoints
- Confirm config has access
- Delete config and delete mount
- File alias
- Encryption at rest
- Store folderId in mount instead of folderpath
- Alert customers if a mount mountedFrom is not found
- Validate file persistence config/credentials before using
- 2 servers, and 2 job runners
- shared resources between different workspaces
- use txns for most all db actions
- should filepath be filePath, namePath or namepath, folderpath or folderPath
- provide a log of all errors to users
- tags and meta for files and other resource + provided resource ID
- delete previous versions, and folder versioning on uploading files?
- file linking and aliasing
- close backend providers
- resolve permitted resource children gradually/in pages, not all at once
- hard delete in db and soft delete in mounts? how will that work without affecting ingestion
- cache most frequently used files from mounted backends and save customers some money
- calculate and show how much you cost customer to ingest, and how much you save them in local caching

- Limits of http, and maybe increase upload limit
- Read up on HTTP streaming
- File status, read available, write available
- Chunk uploading, with js sdk
- Save size after, disable sum usage records for now, and bring back later
- Introductory file locking, should we allow reading when writing, and vice-versa
