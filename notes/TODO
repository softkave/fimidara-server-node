# Server

## Now

## Bugs

- some private endpoints are leaking into rest api and SDK

## Later

- when the agent is public, don't return all data
- add providedId to add and update endpoints for workspace resources
- test usage records
- real-time image transform in a different thread
- multi instance
- track all changes made with system agent and why
- regex match for email not working because email contained +
- do not require rootname if using token
- there was an error with sharp that broke the instance (maybe not waiting for
  promise is why it breaks app)
- in delete jobs, use versions marked deleted for original objects
- usage records
  - usage records alerting
  - UI to set usage thresholds internal
  - make sure api and users can't set thresholds themselves for now, but can read it
  - test usage records on frontend
  - UI to update costs, internal
  - limit how many workspaces a user can create, maybe 3 or 5 for now
- go through apis docs
- hamburger menu
- Resumable uploads
- logs, maybe Sentry
- audit logs
- use local fs?
- remove image resizing for now
- prevent deleting fimidara default org and folders
- check if email recipient is a user and only send login link, or signup link otherwise
- tool to print config without values for env
- cache certain of UsageRecord operations for speed
- email me with new signups in intervals
- what happens when a user still have bandwidth in but no storage?
- fix NotFoundException exception thrown from email deliverability check (AWS SES)
- empty out test s3 bucket and write code to auto clean it after tests
- download folder as zip
- match file with node:fs stat, e.g. last accessed, last status change (though
  we don't have a similar concept), and nano seconds, etc.
- download from anywhere in the internet
- accept ranges
- stop workers on sigint
- use uncreated folder and file path for permissions
- when surfacing jobs, make sure to not surface all info because a job can start
  a job owned by a different workspace, like remove collaborator is linked to
  unassigning a permission group owned by fimidara
