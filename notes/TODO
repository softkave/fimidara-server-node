# Server

  - test usage records on frontend
  - UI to update costs, internal
  - limit how many workspaces a user can create, maybe 3 or 5 for now
- go through apis docs
- hamburger menu
- Resumable uploads

# JS SDK

- support esm and commonjs (current issue is softkave-js-utils only supports esm, and lodash-es + peer deps)
- readFile typedef should return stream | blob depending on responseType
- diff files content?
- optimize node diff files
- optimize copyFolderFiles because currently we fetch all local and fimidara files for diff
  - issue is diff will be incomplete when we diff on paged results
