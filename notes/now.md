## Now

- [ ] Waitlist for fimidara
- [ ] List of accepted collaboration requests whose recipients are not given permission groups yet, and remove permission groups on accept collaboration request for now
- [ ] Stream and start processing uploaded files immediately to avoid files using too much ram
- [ ] Support providedResourceId for all resources
- [ ] In app notification
- [ ] Handle password change required on the frontend
- [ ] Change password with current password or forgot password on the frontend
- [ ] Predefined resize pipelines
- [ ] Public access op for files
- [ ] Get version of readFile, we currently only have Post
- [ ] Mem, shard by workspace and other fields
- [ ] Accepted collaboration requests should be put in their own space
- [ ] Limit assigned permissions depth to 10
- [ ] File and folder exists endpoints
- [ ] Mem, test delete one and delete many items
- [ ] Grant permission should work on the resource level, like allowing access to grant permission for folder and children
- [ ] Mem, sync persisted and current in-memory DBs
- [ ] Add types to force you to write and update Joi schemas
- [ ] Add description/comments to mddoc endpoints and types
- [ ] Filter out agent token ID if the agent type is user
- [ ] resolveEntityPermissions
- [ ] Make sure fields we use for matching are indexed
- [ ] select smallest after index match when correlating
- [ ] Capture stack trace for log functions like appAssert
- [ ] Check if we have a wrapper error and confirm that it's wrapped content is logged when logging it
- [ ] Get tags by name
- [ ] Confirm that queries that should have index hits do
- [ ] Think up a way to add context information to txns and lock timeout errors
- [ ] Write tests to confirm that memstore is faster overall than mongodb
- [ ] A memstore txn lock times out in deleteFolder test
- [ ] Move logs to it's own service and not write directly to DB
- [ ] Revamp UI
- [ ] Refresh jwt tokens and group for collaborators not yet given permission groups
- [ ] Implement public access actions for resources and check that requesting agent has permission to perform action. Can do similar thing for collaboration request's permission groups assigned on accept.
- [ ] Ensure that streaming works on clientside when uploading that the formdata is not waiting for all data to be available b4 uploading
- [ ] Add array or singular item type to permission item mddoc definitions
- [ ] Make sure min and max is set for mddoc fields
- [ ] CORS and origin restrict non-public endpoints to just fimidara frontend
- [ ] remove setRequired from mddoc fieldobject fields, and use requiredField and optionalField
- [ ] either return shorted enums to descriptive text or find a way to add comments to them in api and sdk.
- [ ] docs fns, stripSpaceFromNewline, padNewline, replaceLayoutPlaceholders
- [ ] clarify in docs, endpoints that have required body but same fields can be passed in path or query
- [ ] public / private endpoint getter functions
- [ ] type and field comments from mddoc
- [ ] gen validation schemas from mddoc
- [ ] gen tests from mddoc
- [ ] Include folders, files, names and IDs in error messages?
- [ ] Memstore txn ops shouldn't wait if query or data to insert/update is empty
- [ ] Memstore should run query for multiple queries at once instead of one query per loop. This can also be used to support $or and $and
- [ ] Frontend endpoint doc should be generated for each route to reduce compute and cost. Currently, the file is loaded then rendered.
- [ ] Error boundary page on the frontend
- [ ] Seek file included in readFile
- [ ] Support Blob, UIntArray in js sdk, and ensure that string support works
- [ ] Switch assert to appAssert
- [ ] Include count in paged endpoints

## Later

- [ ] Limit assigned permissions depth to 10
- [ ] Mem, use traversal indexes for gt, gte, lt, lte
- [ ] Use token version when querying tokens
- [ ] Change events and audit logs
- [ ] Email and names should be shorter for regex and escape regex special chars
- [ ] Check file and folder and similar unique resources do not exist b4 creating them. Files are folders are case insensitive
- [ ] Allow provided ID for all workspace resource, and check that it doesn't exist
- [ ] Support $or and $and for queries
- [ ] Check that all tags are saved
- [ ] Ensure that all check auth calls use right actions
- [ ] In the future, implement mark deleted, shallow delete, complete delete, per resource, and allow users to select fields to mask on shallow delete
- [ ] App end
  - [ ] Complete mongo sync
  - [ ] Resumeable deletes
  - [ ] save logs
  - [ ] Graceful application updates
- [ ] Tags and client program tokens on the frontend
- [ ] Public deny all to remove implicit auth and external entity permissions for collaboration requests
- [ ] Monorepo using turbo repo
- [ ] Logs and retries
- [ ] when retrieving cached tokens from the session agent, check that the token contains the input JWTEndpoints
- [ ] copy and centralize all your todos in one place
- [ ] drop max file size for now and reimplement
- [ ] unit tests
- [ ] free flow tags and meta
- [ ] add provided resource ID to all the resources
- [ ] Add to public permission group description what it's for and that it cannot be deleted. Add similar information to admin permission group and that deleting it may lock the admin out of the app
- [ ] Consistent '.' at the end of descriptions and messages
- [ ] delete permission items when entity, container, or resource is deleted
- [ ] write more auth check tests, particularly for ones that shouldn't grant access
- [ ] differentiate between user and collaborator
- [ ] increase the length of nanoids
- [ ] maybe have a separate db for testing mongodataprovider and teardown after test or move away from data providers quickly
- [ ] make workspace ID not required for most APIs since it can be deduced from the tokens. Remove it all together in the JS sdk.
- [ ] should we gate who can see who's permissions
- [ ] swagger API documentation
- [ ] use tags and update the names when workspace names or user names changes
- [ ] free flowing tags
- [ ] sort data by date by default
- [ ] Use extension when file matching so that users can upload files with the same name but with different extensions and test that it works
- [ ] Job to send reminder of collaboration requests to users who haven't accepted or rejected them in a while and when they expire
- [ ] Allow collaboration requests to be resent after a certain time
- [ ] Alert recipients when request is revoked
- [ ] Split free usage thresholds
- [ ] Waitlist and size ups
- [ ] Add usage to workspace and check remaining when uploading or downloading
- [ ] Pipelines should run when the prev is done

- [ ] Scripts should run once
- [ ] New usage thresholds very small
